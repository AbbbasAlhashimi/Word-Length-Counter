# Word-Length-Counter
Word counter that calculate the length of a string.
The way code works:<br>
A) The user Inouts a word or a sentence into the [word_string] input box which will be stored into the InnerHTML (Upon Click) <br>
B) When the button is Clicked, the string passed through out the input box; will be passed to the function as [msg]<br>
C) Whenever the button is clicked, [value.length] method will return the length of the text stored in [word_string]<br>
There are a few comments in the file to make it easier for others to understand the code.<br>The Code implementation can be found on CodePen.io [https://codepen.io/abbbas_alhashimi/pen/KKWXOvM]. <br> Please feel free to reach me out via LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbas-fadhil-ab53ba82/] Kind regards
